# Controller Code for SubHarmonics

Code for the PIC 16F676 microcontroller is found here.

It was developed in C in Microchip's [MPLAB IDE](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/develop/mplab-x-ide).

I programmed the first PIC using my PICKit 3 and my old [k1el PIC Programmer](https://hamcrafters2.com/PICPGM.html), but I've buit an In-Circuit Serial Programming 
Interface into the SubHarmonics Main Board, so you can program direcly on the module:

</p>

The PICKit3 supplies easily enough current to power the module no special setting need to be made during programming.
