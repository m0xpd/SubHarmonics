If you reduce the frequency of SubHarmonics' VCO or apply a clock signal to the 'Ext X In' from an LFO or similar source,
you enable a range of opportunities in Clock Division and Rhythm Generation.

*SubHarmonics as a Clock Divider

The two divider chains of SubHarmonics will offer direct division of the X clock by ratios of:
2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 & 16   (for the A output) 
and
4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, & 18 (for the B output)

These divisions can be set either by the manual m & n divisor controls or by CV inputs.

Many 'secondary' divisions can be established between A and B outputs. 

For example, with m=2 and n=6 the ratio between X and A is 1:2 and the ratio between X and B is 1:6, making the ratio 
between A and B 2:6 (or 1:3).

Similarly, other odd integer ratios can be established via this 'secondary' approach, such that all integer ratios up 
to ten can be achieved:

Similarly, even integer divisions from 10 to 18 can be achieved directly.
