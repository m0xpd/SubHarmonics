This folder contains hardware descriptions of the 'SubHarmonics' module.

The information is presented as EAGLE 'sch' and 'brd' files for the two PCBs and as a small Kicad project for the front panel.

SubHarmonics is implemented in two modules, each of which has its own PCB. There is a Main Board, hosting the majority of the electronics and
a Control Board, which contains all the front panel components including the division indicator LEDs and associated decoders.

The Main Board schematic is available here (or by clicking on the graphic below)
